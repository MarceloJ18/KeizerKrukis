# ML2_Project_JK

# Delivery
Project discussion: after submitting the projects the students will be called to discuss the project with the instructors.
Project groups: the project can be done individually or in groups (the latter is a better option) the groups should not exceed 3 students.

Project Deadline: *June 5th*


You will be asked to deliver a notebook (or more, if you want) with code and explanation of the solution. Clean, “DRY” (Don’t repeat yourself) and clear code will earn extra points in the submission. You can choose to abstract code outside of notebooks but that is not mandatory.
In addition, you will have to submit an executive report with the detail of each segment and suggested campaigns that you would do for each segment - be creative on the campaign suggestion - here are some examples:
● Get an extra 20% on Fish if you buy meat.
● 50% promotion on the entire basket just for you!
● Buy 1 Video Game, get 1 free.
To come up with the promotions, you can play around with association rules on the customer_basket dataset and relate those baskets with the customers on the customer_info one.

# Evalution
The project will be evaluated based on code quality, cleanness and overall quality of the segmentation solution. There is an “ideal solution”, but If you don’t deviate too much from it and you can justify the segments you have discovered, the solution will be considered feasible.
In terms of evaluation parameters, the following will be considered:
● Technical quality of the Segmentation: 8 Points
● Quality of the Report: 4 Points
● Visuals and Explanation: 3 Points
● Interpretation of the Clusters: 2 Points
● Feasibility of Promotions vs. Cluster Interpretation: 3 Points
● Extra: Code quality: +2
